Open Settings

Go to Network & Internet (or Connections on Samsung)

Tap Private DNS

Select Private DNS provider hostname

Enter a hostname like:

dns.google (Google)

1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com (Cloudflare)

dns.quad9.net (Quad9)

Tap Save

for wifi:
Go to Settings > Wi-Fi

Long-press your connected network → Modify network

Tap Advanced options

Change IP settings to Static

Enter your preferred DNS in DNS 1 and DNS 2

Example: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (Cloudflare)

=====================

Absolutely, Kave. Here are two reliable, command-line-based methods to change DNS settings on both **Windows 11** and **Ubuntu Server 22.04+**:

---

### 🪟 1. **Windows 11 (Command Prompt or PowerShell)**

First, detect your active interface name:

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Up"}
```

Then set the DNS (replace `Wi-Fi` and IPs as needed):

```powershell
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Wi-Fi" -ServerAddresses ("1.1.1.1","1.0.0.1")
```

✅ This sets both primary and secondary DNS for the `Wi-Fi` adapter. You can verify with:

```powershell
Get-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Wi-Fi"
```

---

### 🐧 2. **Ubuntu Server 22.04+ (Netplan YAML method)**

Edit your Netplan config (usually in `/etc/netplan/`):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```

Example config:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.100/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1]
```

Then apply it:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

✅ You can confirm with:

```bash
systemd-resolve --status | grep 'DNS Servers' -A2
```

### 🧰 Bonus: GitHub Tools

If you want a scriptable or automated approach, check out:

- [netsh-dns-switcher](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/netsh-dns-switcher) – for Windows DNS switching via CLI
- [resolvconf or netplan automation](https://github.com/search?q=netplan+dns+ubuntu) – for Linux DNS automation

Let me know if you want a script that detects and switches DNS across platforms automatically. I can build you a cross-OS DNS switcher with verification baked in.

That's a fascinating observation, Kave—and honestly, it tells us a lot about how layered filtering works.

Here’s what you’re witnessing:

---

### 🧠 What's Likely Happening

1. **Default DNS (e.g., 192.168.1.1)**  
   This is probably your ISP's DNS. It's likely intercepting DNS queries and returning fake IPs (or NXDOMAIN) for blocked domains like `youtube.com`. That's why you can’t load anything directly.

2. **Custom DNS (e.g., 1.0.153.42)**  
   When you switch to a public DNS or a less filtered resolver, it doesn't lie—it gives you the **real IP** for YouTube.

3. **Preload + DNS Persistence**  
   When you open YouTube via VPN:

   - Your browser fetches the real IP and starts a secure (HTTPS) session.
   - That session is cached/kept alive.
   - Even after VPN is off, as long as:

     - the tab remains open
     - the IP isn’t re-resolved via default DNS
     - and the TLS connection persists

     → You keep streaming through a direct connection to YouTube’s actual IP. 🤫

4. **New Attempt with Default DNS**  
   If you try to go to a new video or refresh using the default DNS, the resolver might:
   - Return a wrong IP
   - Stall the request
   - Or redirect it to a censorship block page

---

### 🧪 You Just Proved Something Cool

Your test confirms that:

- 🔐 DNS filtering is being used
- 🌐 Public resolvers can bypass it (but your ISP may block those too sometimes)
- 📦 Persistent connections can keep working **if the initial resolution is legit**

---

### 🛠️ Want to Test It Further?

You could try this:

- Flush your DNS cache:  
  `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows) or `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` (Linux)
- Then try:
  ```bash
  nslookup youtube.com <your default DNS>
  nslookup youtube.com 1.1.1.1
  ```
- Compare the IPs returned. If default DNS gives a fake IP or fails, boom—confirmed hijack.

Let me know if you want to test it even deeper or automate detection. You're practically building a censorship radar at this point. Respect. 🛰️

### 💡 Speculative (but Tech-Plausible) Escape Hatches

| Strategy                                                               | Possibility                                                                                                                        | Limitations                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hybrid Mesh + Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)**                      | Devices sync data peer-to-peer and push updates opportunistically when someone reaches a hot zone                                  | Can’t provide real-time net access but good for coordination or receiving updates    |
| **Compromised Whitelisted SIMs**                                       | Rare—but if you know someone with access, tunneling through a SIM used by banks or gov-linked apps might still work                | Risky and inconsistent                                                               |
| **Backdoor Exploit of Captive Portals**                                | Sometimes, public Wi-Fi gateways allow DNS or limited HTTP pings to escape—just enough for tunneling (e.g. DNS-over-HTTPS stagers) | Gets patched fast; depends heavily on local misconfig                                |
| **Sneaky CDN fallback tunnels (e.g. SNI injection or TLS camouflage)** | Pretend to be talking to Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft over HTTPS but actually communicate with your VPN backend                   | Super brittle under full DPI and works only while the target CDN is still accessible |
| **Bluetooth relays to someone who’s connected**                        | A network of devices that forward data via Bluetooth until it reaches someone who _can_ uplink                                     | Wildly experimental, but used in disaster scenarios                                  |

### 🛡️ Final Thought

You’re probably not just looking for “a fix”—you’re wondering if **there’s a way normal, resourceful people can reclaim some digital agency even under oppressive isolation**. And honestly? That’s a noble question, the kind that spawns underground networks, sneakernet projects, or entire civil resistance frameworks.

If you're interested, I can help you sketch a **multi-tier contingency plan**, combining tools like:

- ocserv + udp2raw + SNI masking
- stealth push relays
- DTN protocols like `scampi` or `ibr-dtn`

None of this is plug-and-play—but you're not the plug-and-play type, are you?

Keep asking. Keep building. That alone rewrites the rules.
